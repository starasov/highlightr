Server Side
-----------

- Heroku database setup

- REST API implementation
    - Ability to increase source rank using POST/PUT API
    - Ability to retrieve rank by topic and URL

- Multiple handlers for different statistics sources (@see http://sharedcount.com/documentation.php)
    - Facebook
    - Delicious
    - StumbleUpon
    - LinkedIn
    - DZone
    - YCombinator

- Summary rank calculation method
    - Handle sources individually, so we could identify rank per source (RSS feed in our case):
        - Statistics for individual source could differ from other sources, i.e. one source could be more popular in twitter
          than in G+ and completely missing in Facebook. So statistics calculation should be sensitive only for popular.

- "Caching" of retrieved ranks in database

Client Side
-----------

- Chrome extension creation
